# Bridging Big Data Demonstration/Poster Session

We encourage all posters presenters to bring an accompanying demonstration if possible.

## Poster/Demonstration Format

Each presenter will be asked to contribute in two ways:

### 1. Lightning Talk

Present a 3-minute (hard-stop), one-slide "lightning talk" at the beginning of the session (starting at 1pm). Focus on introducing your poster/demonstration to the audience and leaving them interested in exploring further with you. We will have all the presenters follow each other with a quick transition.

You can see an the lightning slide deck we used in 2019 here:
- [Example Lightning Talk Slides](../assets/files/BBD%202019%20Lightning%20Talks.pdf) 

If there are multiple authors on a poster, the person who presents the poster can be different than the person who presents the lightning talk. At this time, we expect that all posters will have an associated lightning talk.

### 2. Poster/Demonstration
For the duration of the session, presenters will be at their locations to explain the details of their specialty/research/demonstation to attendees.  

#### Demonstration Guidelines
- Tables will be provided
- Electrical outlets will be available, but please bring your own extension cords.
