# Bridging Big Data Demonstration/Poster Session

We encourage all posters presenters to bring an accompanying demonstration if possible.

## Poster/Demonstration Format

Each presenter will be asked to contribute in two ways:

### 1. Lightning Talk

We will create a lightning talk slide deck based on the posters received. Each poster will have 1 minute to present their work. Focus on introducing your poster/demonstration to the audience and leaving them interested in exploring further with you. We will have all the presenters follow each other with a quick transition.

You can see an the lightning slide deck we used in 2019 here:
- [Example Lightning Talk Slides](../assets/files/BBD%202019%20Lightning%20Talks.pdf) 

If there are multiple authors on a poster, the person who presents the poster can be different than the person who presents the lightning talk. At this time, we expect that all posters will have an associated lightning talk.

Lightning Talk Plan: 
1.	Before the workshop: I will create a presentation with each poster as a slide. Before the workshop I will share a copy of this presentation to verify its accuracy.
2.	During the workshop: Right before we start, I will need one author from each poster to join me near the microphone.
3.	During the workshop: During the lightning talks themselves, each slide will be shown for one minute before automatically moving to the next  slide.
4.	During the workshop: When the lightning talks are done, you will move to your poster.


### 2. Poster/Demonstration
