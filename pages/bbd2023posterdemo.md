# Bridging Big Data Demonstration/Poster Session

We encourage all posters presenters to bring an accompanying demonstration if possible.

## Poster/Demonstration Format

Each presenter will be asked to contribute in two ways:

### 1. Lightning Talk

Present a 3-minute (hard-stop), one-slide "lightning talk" at the beginning of the session (starting at 1pm). Focus on introducing your poster/demonstration to the audience and leaving them interested in exploring further with you. We will have all the presenters follow each other with a quick transition.

You can see an the lightning slide deck we used in 2019 here:

### 2. Poster/Demonstration
For the duration of the session, presenters will be at their locations to explain the details of their specialty/research/demonstation to attendees.  

#### Demonstration Guidelines
- Tables will be provided
