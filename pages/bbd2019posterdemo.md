# Bridging Big Data Demonstration/Poster Session

We encourage all posters presenters to bring an accompanying demonstration if possible.

## Poster/Demonstration Format

Each presenter will be asked to contribute in two ways:

### 1. Lightning Talk

Present a 1 minute "lightning talk" at the beginning of the session (starting at 1pm). Focus on introducing your poster/demonstration to the audience and leaving them interested in exploring further with you. We will have the presenters follow each other with a quick transition.

### 2. Poster/Demonstration
For the duration of the session, presenters will be at their locations to explain the details of their specialty/research/demonstation to attendees.  
**Setup:** We will provide tables for monitors and laptops. Electrical outlets will be available but please bring your own extension cords.

## Poster Guidelines

For those presenting posters we will have boards and easels.
- Poster size should be 48” x 36” or less.
- Author(s) name(s), institution(s) and funding source(s) should appear on the poster.
- The title should be properly capitalized with a minimum font size of 80 points.
- The text should be written with a minimum font size of 18 points.

You are encouraged, but not required, to use a poster template. One such template can be found at the following url: [https://osf.io/6ua4k/](https://osf.io/6ua4k/)
