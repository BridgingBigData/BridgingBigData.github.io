# Activities

Our collaboration on Big Data and bridge health has resulted in numerous presentations, workshops, etc. Below is a running list of such activities:

## Professional development

- Feb 2020: PhD Students Akshay and Anoop attended a TRB Webinar, _Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Deterioration of Highway Bridges_

## Presentations

- March 2019: We presented the SMARTI project at the Nebraska Bridge Conference https://www.ltap.unl.edu/neltap/Events.asp with bridge stakeholders from across Nebraska.  We also conducted an online survey with attendees of the conference to understand their immediate decision making and information needs. This survey is now informing our sensor selection and configuration efforts.

- MBDH 2018 All hands meeting: We discussed the SMARTI project as a lightning talk and poster session.

- MBDH 2019 All hands meeting, October 29-30, 2019 Big Ten Center, Rosemont IL: We discussed the SMARTI project updates in the Spoke updates session. 

- ISCRAM - We have presented our SMARTI framework and related research program at the 16th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management (ISCRAM). 

- KICT Collaborations, Korea - Several discussions with visiting researchers from Korea Institute of Civil engineering and building Technology (KICT), a government research lab. KICT's research team are currently engaged in big data driven preventive maintenance technologies for civil infrastructures. 

- University of Agder, Norway -  We have presented SMARTI research and outcomes at a workshop hosted in Houston by our collaborators at the University of Agder's Center for Integrated Emergency Management. The Houston based Norwegian Consulate organized this event. We are working closely with our Norwegian partner in their effort to develop a similar Big Data for Infrastructure effort through the Norwegian government.

- UKC 2019 - We participated the Smart Science, Engineering, and Health for Livable Communities Conference, including the Data Science Hackathon/Workshop. Tools for data visualization and image classification using convolutional neural networks for covered in the workshop.  

- IWSHM 2019 (International Workshop for Structural Health Monitoring)  - A peer reviewed conference proceeding "Computer-Vision Based UAV Inspection for Steel Bridge Connections" was accepted. Presentation was given at Stanford, CA on September 10-12, 2019 by Jiyoung Lee (PhD student in Computer Science) and Chungwook Sim (Faculty member in Civil Engineering).
