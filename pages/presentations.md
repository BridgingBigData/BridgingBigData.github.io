 ## Workshops Organized
 
  - Bridging Big Data 2016 Conference
   
   We hosted the 2nd annual 2016 Bridging Big Data Workshop on November 4, 2016 at the Scott Conference Center in Omaha, Nebraska. With sixty-two registrations, attendees included bridge owners from the public and private sectors, civil engineering and IT researchers, and infrastructure solution providers. The workshop sessions generated many discussions identifying pain points for collecting, curating and sharing bridge health data and opportunities to innovate with Big Data technologies.  The workshop has energized this community, which was apparent from the many discussions that the project team had with the attendees.
