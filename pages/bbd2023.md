## BBD 2023: Intelligent Infrastructure Health Monitoring at the Edge: Lessons Learned and Future Directions

The Bridging Big Data 2023 workshop (BBD 2023) will bring together bridge dataset owners, data instrumentation providers, big data solution providers, and academics to discuss current and future trends in data-informed intelligent infrastructure health monitoring techniques at the network's edge. Through this workshop, we seek to understand the pressing needs for bridge infrastructure health monitoring from design, sensing, data management, economic, and socio-political perspectives. As with prior workshops, we will continue to focus on smart big data pipelines for aging rural bridge transportation infrastructure - by showcasing sensing and big data technology applications, highlighting solutions to data discovery and controlled sharing challenges, and novel data-driven decision-making tools.

The morning keynote in will focus on current capability gaps and new approaches needed to support the concept of "persistent" engineer intelligence and how data, technology, and engineering can be used to continuously monitor the built infrastructure at the network's edge. Before lunch, a panel of leading experts will discuss present approaches to support intelligent infrastructure health monitoring applications.

Afternoon activities will feature lightning talks and a second keynote. The lightning talks and posters will feature technologies and data products that improve infrastructure health assessment. The keynote will discuss the need for autonomy in decision-making for infrastructure health at the network's edge and the current needs and emerging solutions.

Professional Development Units/Continuing Education Credits will be provided to workshop attendees.
