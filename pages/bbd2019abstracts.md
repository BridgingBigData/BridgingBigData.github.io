Ann Christine Catlin is a Senior Research Scientist in Research Computing at Purdue University. Catlin has collaborated with hundreds of faculty, physicians, pharmacists and other researchers in medical and scientific disciplines to build customized data and computing platforms for investigating research questions in civil engineering, electrical engineering, natural disasters, computational chemistry, ecotoxicology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical device informatics, adverse drug events, and cancer treatments. Her work has been funded by NSF, NIH, EPA, NIST, FDA, DoD, academic centers and national foundations, with more than 50 publications describing the design and implementation of her research platforms or the outcomes produced through shared use of these platforms. Catlinâ€™s recent work is focused on the development of research platforms that support the full investigative lifecycle and are effective across science domains.

  > Abstract: Decades of government funding has targeted development of platforms that fully support team-shared research and are effective across science domains. Even so, most existing platforms offer support only for specific research activities, such as file sharing or HPC computing, and platforms that offer more complete support are heavily customized for specific scientific disciplines. As a result, most researchers continue to carry out their investigations in an ad hoc manner. This means their collected data, files, code, analyses and outcomes are fragmented, seriously complicating data preservation, sharing, interoperability, results traceability, publication, reuse and re-interpretation. In this presentation, we introduce the Digital Environment for Enabling Data-driven Science (DEEDS), a platform that provides comprehensive, end-to-end solutions for data, computing and scientific workflows. DEEDS is an extensible web-services platform that supports research projects throughout the investigation lifecycle, offering an interactive, user-friendly, team-shared dashboard where researchers can 1) organize research activities, 2) import, preserve, and manage data, 3) integrate and launch research computing tools, also supporting their execution on HPC resources, 4) connect data to tools, including capture of computational workflows for data provenance and reproducibility of results, 5) interactively explore, compute on, and visualize data and 6) apply access control as needed. The DEEDS platform was developed as a collaborative effort between computer scientists and domain scientists, including civil engineers, who jointly established requirements for functionality and usability. DEEDS datasets and operation will be demonstrated for two SMARTI research projects: Rural bridge health studies based on interactive data tables for collected NBI inspection data, trend analysis tools, Jupyter notebooks, and built-in R analytics and Bridge health monitoring and decision-making based on collected sensor data, machine learning algorithms for damage detection/classification, and outcomes visualization and analyses.
