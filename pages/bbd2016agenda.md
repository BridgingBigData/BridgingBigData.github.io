Open Data and Bridges: Reflections on Data Stewardship and Wide, Safety Critical Data**  
Abstract:  
_Twenty years ago Dr. Goggins was hanging off of railroad bridges and testing handheld bridge inspection software he was designing for a railroad bridge engineering firm. Fast forward to 2016 and 8 years of research examining open online community systems like Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, Github & others, there are similarities and differences that are vital to consider. Dr. Goggins outlines what he anticipates to be key policy and technical obstacles to the kind of open data sharing environment for bridge infrastructure that will be necessary to positively impact public safety._
