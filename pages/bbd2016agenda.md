### Keynote 1
**9:30 – 10:15 a.m.**        
**Real-time sharing of Data in the Airline Industry**  
Abstract:  
_Big data is usually associated with large NO-SQL, column based databases, pure data science and machine learning.  As the internet of things (IoT) is proliferated more and more into transportation infrastructure and vehicles include ever-increasing number of sensors, computational intelligence with communication, and IoT capabilities Big Data is moving rapidly into the transportation related fields.  It is usually forgotten that Big Data is not only identified by large volume high speed data but alternatively, and this is the case in the transportation related big data field, by highly complex data from a large variety of sources.  Smaller volume but complex data with larger data source variety pose challenges in the application of Big Data techniques.  These challanges require in addition to, or in many cases instead of, pure data science and machine learning, the elaborate use of physical/engineering subject matter knowledge to unlock the potentials of Big Data applications. This presentation will illustrate in details using a real life commercial application the use of vehicle and infrastructure knowledge in a Big Data application that uses commercial revenue passenger aircrafts in assessing runway conditions real time and monetizing the collected and analyzed data._

### Break

Networking Break (Coffee provided)

### Keynote 2
**10:30 – 11:15 a.m.   
Open Data and Bridges: Reflections on Data Stewardship and Wide, Safety Critical Data**  
Abstract:  
_Twenty years ago Dr. Goggins was hanging off of railroad bridges and testing handheld bridge inspection software he was designing for a railroad bridge engineering firm. Fast forward to 2016 and 8 years of research examining open online community systems like Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, Github & others, there are similarities and differences that are vital to consider. Dr. Goggins outlines what he anticipates to be key policy and technical obstacles to the kind of open data sharing environment for bridge infrastructure that will be necessary to positively impact public safety._

### Keynote 3
**11:15 – 11:45 a.m.   
Managing Bridge Data using DataHub**  
**[Slides](https://bridgingbigdata.github.io/pages/Bridging%20Big%20Data3.pdf)**  
Abstract:  
_The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) brings together data from hundreds of thousands of bridges nationwide in a compact format. But these data are just a fraction of what state DOTs collect each year. Inspectors make observations, fill out forms, collect photographs, run calculations, and ultimately write reports for thousands of bridges per year. The data collections they produce are managed at the state level, disconnected from the NBI summary data. [DataHub](http://datacenterhub.org) offers an easy way of organizing files from bridge inspections, connecting these file collections to bridge characteristics like those in the NBI, and sharing these data. In doing so, it can make it easier for bridge owners to manage their data and for researchers to study bridge health._

### Lunch and Keynote 4  
**12:30 – 1:30 p.m., Keynote starts at 12:45 p.m.   
Chicago: City of Big Data**   
**[Slides](https://bridgingbigdata.github.io/pages/City%20of%20Big%20Data.pdf)**  
Speaker:    
_[Tom Schenk](http://tomschenkjr.net) - Chief Data Officer, City of Chicago_  
Abstract:  
This presentation will provide a contemporary account of how Chicago has incorporated more data-driven practices into its daily operations. Beginning with transparency through the open data portal, Chicago has also incorporated predictive analytics to allocate inspectors and new technologies such as IoT and new scanning technology to collect more data.
