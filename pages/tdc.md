# Twitter
Use the hashtag ```#tdcLincoln``` to talk about it and share ideas/pictures/feedback.

# Theme
Traffic deaths across the United States increased 14% over the last two years. In 2016, nearly 6,000 pedestrians died – the highest number in more than two decades. Data science collaboration has the potential to reverse this trend – this Challenge aims to do just that.

# What is the Challenge?
At Lincoln the National Transportation Data Challenge is a `hackathon` to build and strengthen collaborative data science projects that advance transportation safety. Students will work in teams in a open and creative thinking format. Mentors will be available to consult with teams and share best practices for data hacking! Travel support and prizes will be sponsored by the Midwest Big Data Hub

# Hackathon Focus Areas

## BIKE / PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
- How might we improve bike/pedestrian safety in our communities?

## WEATHER / EMERGENCY RESPONSE
