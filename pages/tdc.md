# Code of Conduct
By participating in this Hackathon, you choose to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## Applicability
This code of conduct serves to ensure that everybody and anybody who wishes to participate is able to do so. Further, it applies to online activities related to the Hackathon, including postings on GitHub, Slack, and other online sites.

## Principles
**Do Not Harass**
Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be harassment.

## Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others
The hackathon is a place for people all of different skill levels and approaches to meet and work together toward common goals. As a result, we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However, we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.

Additionally, we expect that members will educate others respectfully. To this end, do not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.

## Keep Your Team Open
Except for instances where it would significantly impede productivity, there is always room on a project for one more person. Unless doing so would be counter-productive to the goals of the project, anybody who is interested in a project is allowed to join it.

## Aspirations
While this document exists primarily to prevent certain bad behavior, we also believe that our community members should work towards a higher standard. To that end, we strongly encourage the following conduct, though they are considered aspirational rather than necessary.

## Build With, Not For
Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in all stages of development. Seek out those who are under-represented, and remove barriers to access. Listen as much—or more—than you speak, and give full consideration to all ideas, even if they seem improbable at first.

## Empower, Experiment, and Find a Way for Everybody to Contribute
When more people share their knowledge and skills, they give a project a greater chance to succeed. When somebody shows up with an unusual skill, look for ways to fit them into the team rather than reasons why it wouldn’t work. Experiment with new approaches, and don’t be afraid to try something that might not work.

# Theme
Traffic deaths across the United States increased 14% over the last two years. In 2016, nearly 6,000 pedestrians died – the highest number in more than two decades. Data science collaboration has the potential to reverse this trend – this Challenge aims to do just that.

# What is the Challenge?
At Lincoln the National Transportation Data Challenge is a `hackathon` to build and strengthen collaborative data science projects that advance transportation safety. Students will work in teams in a open and creative thinking format. Mentors will be available to consult with teams and share best practices for data hacking! Travel support and prizes will be sponsored by the Midwest Big Data Hub

# Hackathon Focus Areas

## Bike/Pedestrian Safety
How might we improve **bike/pedestrian safety** in our communities?

**Category Chair**
Robert Hoffer, Chief Technology Officer, Satori (MZ.com)

> Robert Hoffer is a serial entrepreneur and inventor of several products in the computer and internet industry. As founder of Query Labs he developed one of the first Web based Yellow and White Page directory services products, which launched at Yahoo as phone.yahoo.com. Robert co-founded ActiveBuddy which launched SmarterChild - the first commercial instant messaging bot. Robert has several patents in the field of instant messaging. He currently not only advises companies in their technology strategies but continues to develop and innovate in the tech space.  His focus will be on the application of streaming data aggregation uniquely relevant to private/public transportation data sets towards implementable life-saving interventions.  

## Weather/Emergency Response
- How might we improve **transportation safety** in extreme weather? In cases of crises?   

**Category Chair**
Amy Unruh, Developer relations, Google

> Amy Unruh is a developer programs engineer for the Google Cloud Platform, with a focus on machine learning and data analytics as well as other Cloud Platform technologies. Amy has an academic background in CS/AI and has also worked at several startups, done industrial R&D, and published a book on App Engine.  Amy’s focus during the challenge will be on leveraging the latest utility in open source and donated computing resources (including DataScience Platform, TensorFlow, Big Query, Satori, and other big data tools) to address hypotheses leading towards life saving interventions from the vast streaming and archival data, such as Waze and weather, available for municipalities.

## Hackathon format

Teams of participants (up to 4) will *hack* available datasets to produce meaningful insights along the two thematic areas listed above. The projects should demonstrate data-driven *decision making* with meaningful insights for *social and technological impact*. Mentors will be available onsite to help brainstorm project ideas and suggest ways to accomplish tangible outcomes. There are no other restrictions on project types and their outcomes. Got creativity?

Wireless network access will be provided. So you may choose to bring your own laptops.

## Available Datasets and Resources
* The following datasets will be used for the competition: [https://www.bigdatahubs.io/resources/](https://www.bigdatahubs.io/resources/).
