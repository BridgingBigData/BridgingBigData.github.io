## Creating common schemas for Bridge Deficiencies
- [JSON-Schemas](https://github.com/BridgingBigData/bridgehealthschema) made available on Github

## Converting NBI Data into Structured JSON 
- [NBI MongoDB Pipeline](https://github.com/kaleoyster/nbi-pipeline)

## Analyzing Nebraska Bridge Inspection Records
- [Jupyter Notebook with MongoDB for analyzing all NBI records from 1992 to 2016 with over 17 million records](https://github.com/BridgingBigData/notebooks/blob/master/NBI%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook with MongoDB to link Nebraska DOT and NBI datasets](https://robinagandhi.github.io/r/mongoNBI.html)
- [R markdown for Nebraska Bridge analysis based on NBI data](https://robinagandhi.github.io/r/NEBridges.html)

## NBI compute infrastructure at Labs Workbench, a service of the National Data Service (NDS), a MBDH Infrastructure Partner
This repository contains preliminary information related to the NDS Labs National Bridge Infrastructure (NBI) data pilot. This pilot consists of a MongoDB containing the NBI dataset and a Jupyter environment with sample notebook for use in the Labs Workbench system.
