# Enabling Access to Bridge Dataset Access in Big Data Pipelines

## Nebraska DoT Bridge Inspection Records Dataset cross-linked with National Bridge Inventory
- Platform: datacenterhub.org
- Chungwook Sim; Robin Gandhi; David M Gee; Ajay Khampariya; Akshay Kale; Dreizan Moore (2017), "Nebraska Bridge Data," https://datacenterhub.org/resources/14392. To request access please contact [Chungwook Sim](http://engineering.unl.edu/civil/faculty/chungwook-sim/).

## Creating common schemas for Bridge Deficiencies
- [JSON-Schemas](https://github.com/BridgingBigData/bridgehealthschema) made available on Github

## Analyzing Nebraska Bridge Inspection Records
- [Jupyter Notebook with MongoDB for analyzing all NBI records from 1992 to 2016 with over 17 million records](https://github.com/BridgingBigData/notebooks/blob/master/NBI%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook with MongoDB to link Nebraska DOT and NBI datasets](http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/r/mongoNBI.html)
- [R markdown for Nebraska Bridge analysis based on NBI data](http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/r/NEBridges.html)

## NBI compute infrastructure at Labs Workbench, a service of the National Data Service (NDS), a MBDH Infrastructure Partner
This repository contains preliminary information related to the NDS Labs National Bridge Infrastructure (NBI) data pilot. This pilot consists of a MongoDB containing the NBI dataset and a Jupyter environment with sample notebook for use in the Labs Workbench system.
