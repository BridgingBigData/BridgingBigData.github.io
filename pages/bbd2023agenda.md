<summary>more</summary>

She leverages emergent assessment techniques from other disciplines and brings them to bear on the problem of remote structural assessments, including persistent geophysical monitoring and exploitation of satellite or other overhead imagery in conjunction with knowledge of non-U.S. construction and maintenance practices.  
Her novel and unconventional approach has resulted in new tools and techniques that enhance Warfighter safety, while advancing the state- of-the-art in bridge assessment as applied to both military and civil infrastructure challenges.    
Dr. Whitlow leads multi-disciplinary teams of scientists and engineers with backgrounds in structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, acoustics, signal propagation, and meteorology focused on solving engineering problems and providing bridge assessment and monitoring solutions to both the military and civilian sectors. Her published research spans the breadth of bridge assessment from traditional large-scale structural testing to non-traditional use of emergent technologies for real-time persistent health monitoring.   
Dr. Whitlow is an active member of the NATO Team of Experts on Military Bridge Assessment under the NATO Military Engineering Working Group. She is also a Professional Engineer in the State of Mississippi and a member of the Society of American Military Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers.
