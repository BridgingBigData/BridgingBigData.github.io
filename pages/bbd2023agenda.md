Using geophysics and geotechnical engineering to proactively manipulate and assess the near-surface interface, she executes and fosters research to meet multi-domain threat assessment and maneuver goals, through high-performance computing simulations, analytical analysis, and laboratory and field experimentation, with applications for both civil and military end-users across multiple Department of Defense (DoD), federal, intelligence and academic communities. Dr. McKenna Taylor is the Co-Chair of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Augmentation Working Group, (AAA WG) and serves as the Basic Research 6.1 Advisor for the ERDC Adaptive Protection, Maneuver, Geospatial, and Natural Sciences Research Portfolio.  
Dr. McKenna Taylor is the author of numerous journal articles, technical reports, and other publications on a wide variety of geophysical and geotechnical topics. Dr. McKenna Taylor holds a B.S. in Physics with a Chemistry minor from Georgetown University (1999) and a Ph.D. in Geophysics from Southern Methodist University (2005). She is a Certified Professional Geologist (#11410) from The American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) and a Registered Professional Geologist in the state of Alaska (#661). Dr. McKenna is actively involved in the Military Sensing Symposiums (Battlefield Acoustics, Magnetic, and Seismic/Electromagnetics), as well as the American Geophysical Union and the Acoustical Society of America.  
Prior to joining ERDC in 2005, and while pursuing her Ph.D, Dr. McKenna Taylor taught Geophysics and Geology at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas (1999-2005), and conducted research in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. She is currently an adjunct professor in the Huffington Department of Geological Sciences at SMU and the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of Mississippi State University.

### Panelists

#### **Danielle Whitlow, PhD, PE**,  Research Civil Engineer, [U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil)  

> ![Dr. Danielle Whitlow](https://bridgingbigdata.github.io/pages/images/whitlow.png)   

Dr. Whitlow is a recognized expert in the international community in non-traditional bridge assessment techniques.

<details>
<summary>more</summary>

She leverages emergent assessment techniques from other disciplines and brings them to bear on the problem of remote structural assessments, including persistent geophysical monitoring and exploitation of satellite or other overhead imagery in conjunction with knowledge of non-U.S. construction and maintenance practices.  
Her novel and unconventional approach has resulted in new tools and techniques that enhance Warfighter safety, while advancing the state- of-the-art in bridge assessment as applied to both military and civil infrastructure challenges.    
Dr. Whitlow leads multi-disciplinary teams of scientists and engineers with backgrounds in structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, acoustics, signal propagation, and meteorology focused on solving engineering problems and providing bridge assessment and monitoring solutions to both the military and civilian sectors. Her published research spans the breadth of bridge assessment from traditional large-scale structural testing to non-traditional use of emergent technologies for real-time persistent health monitoring.   
Dr. Whitlow is an active member of the NATO Team of Experts on Military Bridge Assessment under the NATO Military Engineering Working Group. She is also a Professional Engineer in the State of Mississippi and a member of the Society of American Military Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers.
